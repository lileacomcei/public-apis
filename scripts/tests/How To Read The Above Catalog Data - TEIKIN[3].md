One of the most popular products of Teikin is their pistons. Teikin pistons are made of a unique fine-grain structure composite that gives them a perfect balance of weight and strength. They can withstand high inertia, thermal load and intense pressure that are common in modern engines.
 
Teikin pistons also have advanced features, such as ring grooves that are armored with metallurgically bonded inserts and cooling galleries that are embedded inside the pistons' crown. These features enhance the performance and durability of the pistons. Moreover, Teikin pistons have anodized surfaces and self-lubricating coatings for protection.
 
Another product that Teikin offers is their piston rings. Teikin piston rings are designed to fit precisely with the pistons and the cylinder liners or block. They ensure a smooth and efficient operation of the engine by sealing the combustion chamber, regulating the oil consumption and transferring the heat.
 
Teikin piston rings are made of high-quality materials, such as steel, cast iron and alloy. They have different types and shapes, depending on the engine requirements and specifications. Teikin piston rings also have special treatments, such as chrome plating, nitriding and phosphate coating, to improve their wear resistance and corrosion resistance.
