# How to Perform Arya Samaj Sandhya With Visual Mantra
 
Arya Samaj Sandhya is a daily ritual of worship and meditation that is practiced by the followers of Arya Samaj, a reformist Hindu movement founded by Swami Dayananda Saraswati in the 19th century. The word Sandhya means "junction" or "transition" and refers to the three times of the day when the sun rises, reaches its zenith, and sets. These are considered auspicious moments for spiritual practice and reflection.
 
The main component of Arya Samaj Sandhya is the recitation of the Gayatri Mantra, a sacred verse from the Rig Veda that invokes the universal power of Savitri, the sun god. The Gayatri Mantra is considered to be the essence of all Vedas and the best mantra for worship. It is said to bestow wisdom, enlightenment, and happiness to those who chant it with devotion and understanding.

The Gayatri Mantra is as follows:

    Om bhoor bhuvah svah
    Tat savitur varenyam
    Bhargo devasya dheemahi
    Dhiyo yo nah prachodayat

The meaning of the mantra is:

    We meditate on the glorious splendor of Savitri,
    Who illuminates the three worlds - physical, astral, and causal.
    May he stimulate our intellect and guide us on the right path.

To perform Arya Samaj Sandhya, one needs to follow a sequence of steps that include purification, invocation, offering, meditation, and gratitude. The ritual can be done individually or in a group, preferably facing east or west depending on the time of the day. A simple altar with a lamp, incense, flowers, and water can be arranged for the ritual.
 
The steps of Arya Samaj Sandhya are:
 
1. Aachamanam: This is the first step of purification, where one sips water from the right palm three times while chanting a mantra that invokes the blessings of the divine mother. The mantra is:

        Om shanno deveer abhishtaya aapo bhavantu peetaye
        Shanyor abhi shravantu nah

2. Indriyasparsha: This is the second step of purification, where one touches different parts of the body with water while chanting mantras that invoke the protection and guidance of various deities. The mantras are:

        Om vaang me asya astu (touch mouth)
        Om nasor me prano astu (touch nose)
        Om akshnor me chakshur astu (touch eyes)
        Om karnayor me shrotram astu (touch ears)
        Om bahvor me balam astu (touch arms)
        Om oorvor me ojo astu (touch thighs)
        Om arishtani me angani tanustanva me saha santu (touch whole body)

3. Pranayama: This is the third step of purification, where one regulates the breath while chanting mantras that invoke the cosmic energy of Om. The mantras are:

        Om bhuh om (inhale through left nostril and exhale through right nostril)
        Om bhuvah om (inhale through right nostril and exhale through left nostril)
        Om svah om (inhale through both nostrils and exhale through both nostrils)

4. Sankalpa: This is the fourth step of purification, where one makes a mental resolve to perform the ritual with sincerity and devotion. The mantra is:

        Om mamopatta samasta duritakshayadvara shri parameshvara preetyartham pratah sandhyam upasishye (morning)
        Om mamopatta samasta duritakshayadvara shri parameshvara preetyartham madhyahnika sandhyam upasishye (noon)
        Om mamopatta samasta duritakshayadvara shri parameshvara preetyartham sayam sandhyam upasishye (evening)
