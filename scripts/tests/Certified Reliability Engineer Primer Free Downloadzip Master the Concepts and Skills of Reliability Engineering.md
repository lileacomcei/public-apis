# How to Prepare for the Certified Reliability Engineer Exam
 
If you are a professional who wants to improve product or system reliability, you may be interested in taking the Certified Reliability Engineer (CRE) exam offered by the American Society for Quality (ASQ). The CRE exam is a four-hour, 150-question multiple-choice test that covers various topics related to reliability engineering, such as reliability management, probability and statistics, design for reliability, reliability testing and modeling, and risk management.
 
However, passing the CRE exam is not easy. You need to have at least eight years of verifiable experience and/or education in reliability engineering or related fields. You also need to study hard and review the relevant concepts and principles. Fortunately, there are some resources that can help you prepare for the CRE exam, such as:

- The **Certified Reliability Engineer Primer** from the Quality Council of Indiana. This is a comprehensive book that covers all the topics in the CRE Body of Knowledge. It also includes sample questions, answers, and explanations. You can order a hard copy or download a zip file of the primer from their website[^1^].
- The **Certified Reliability Engineer Handbook** from ASQ. This is another useful reference that provides detailed information and examples on reliability engineering topics. It also contains case studies and best practices from various industries. You can buy the second edition of the handbook from Amazon or other online retailers[^2^].
- The **Engineering Professional Practice: Fundamentals of Engineering** book from Pearson. This is a general book that introduces the history, philosophy, and application of engineering. It also covers some basic vocabulary and concepts of applied engineering. You can find this book on Sway or other online platforms[^3^].
- The **Open Tools for Analysis, Design, and Simulation (ATE)** software from Embedded Test Environment. This is a free software that allows you to perform various reliability engineering tasks, such as reliability analysis, design optimization, failure mode and effects analysis, fault tree analysis, and Monte Carlo simulation. You can download a zip file of the software from their website[^4^].

By using these resources, you can improve your knowledge and skills in reliability engineering and increase your chances of passing the CRE exam. However, you should also practice your problem-solving and critical thinking abilities by taking mock tests and reviewing your answers. You can find some online practice tests on ASQ's website or other sources.
 
Remember that becoming a certified reliability engineer is not only a personal achievement but also a professional advantage. It can help you demonstrate your competence and credibility in your field and enhance your career opportunities and growth. Therefore, it is worth investing your time and effort to prepare for the CRE exam.
