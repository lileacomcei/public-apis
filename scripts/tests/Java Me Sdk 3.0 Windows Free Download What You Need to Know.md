## Conclusion
 
In this article, we have shown you how to download and install Java ME SDK 3.0 for Windows XP and Vista 32-bit. This SDK allows you to develop applications for mobile devices that run on Java ME platform. You can also use plugins for NetBeans or Eclipse IDEs to integrate Java ME SDK with your preferred development environment.
  
## Step 4: Create a New Java ME Project
 
To create a new Java ME project, you can use the New Project wizard in Eclipse. Select File > New > Project and choose Java ME > MIDlet Suite Project. Click Next to proceed.
 
You will need to enter some basic information about your project, such as the project name, the MIDlet suite name, the vendor name and the version number. You can also choose the target platform and device for your project. For example, you can select CLDC 1.1 and DefaultCldcPhone1 as the platform and device respectively. Click Next to continue.
 
The next step is to configure the application descriptor for your project. The application descriptor is an XML file that contains information about your MIDlet suite, such as the name, icon, permissions and attributes of each MIDlet. You can use the wizard to add or edit these information. Click Next to proceed.
 
The final step is to create the source folder and package for your project. The source folder is where you will store your Java source files. The package is a way of organizing your classes into namespaces. You can use the default values or change them as you wish. Click Finish to create your project.
 
## Step 5: Write and Run Your First Java ME Application
 
To write your first Java ME application, you will need to create a new class that extends the javax.microedition.midlet.MIDlet class. This class is the main entry point of your application and defines its lifecycle methods: startApp, pauseApp and destroyApp.
 
You can use the New Class wizard in Eclipse to create a new class. Select File > New > Class and choose your project and package as the source folder and package respectively. Enter a name for your class, such as HelloWorldMIDlet, and select javax.microedition.midlet.MIDlet as the superclass. Click Finish to create your class.
 
You will see a skeleton code for your class in the editor window. You can add some code to display a simple message on the screen using the javax.microedition.lcdui.Display and javax.microedition.lcdui.Alert classes. For example, you can write something like this:

    import javax.microedition.lcdui.Alert;
    import javax.microedition.lcdui.Display;
    import javax.microedition.midlet.MIDlet;
    
    public class HelloWorldMIDlet extends MIDlet 
    
        public void startApp() 
            Display display = Display.getDisplay(this);
            Alert alert = new Alert("Hello World", "This is my first Java ME application", null, null);
            display.setCurrent(alert);

        public void pauseApp() 

        public void destroyApp(boolean unconditional) 

To run your application, you will need to launch it using the Java ME SDK emulator. You can use the Run As wizard in Eclipse to do this. Select Run > Run As > Java ME MIDlet Suite and choose your project as the MIDlet suite to launch. Click Run to start the emulator.
 
You will see a window that simulates a mobile device running your application. You should see an alert message that says "Hello World" on the screen, as shown in Figure 4-7.
