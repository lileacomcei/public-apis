Angry Birds Space, the popular game that features the angry birds in a space-themed setting, has just released a new update that adds more levels and features to the game. The update is called Mars the Red Planet, and it brings 20 new levels that are set on the surface of Mars[^1^]. The new levels are challenging and fun, and they also introduce a new power-up: the Mars Curiosity Rover[^1^]. The rover can help the birds by shooting lasers at the pigs or by creating explosions[^1^].
 
In addition to the new levels, the update also brings a couple of more goodies. First off, the update adds the first Angry Birds Star Wars level to Angry Birds Space[^1^]. This is a crossover between the two games that features the birds and pigs dressed as characters from the Star Wars franchise[^1^]. The level is based on the planet Tatooine, and it has some special elements like lightsabers and blasters[^1^]. And if you are not a fan of the Angry Birds in space concept, the update also brings a very popular level to Angry Birds Star Wars. The level is called Death Star 2, and it is based on the final battle from Return of the Jedi[^1^]. The level has some epic moments like flying through the Death Star's core and destroying its reactor[^1^].

Finally, the new update brings a few more features to the Angry Birds games. Players can now choose between the old "A-B-X" and the new "T-R-S" characters[^1^]. They also can now choose how many birds and pigs they want to use in a level[^1^]. And the last new feature is a new sound effects options menu where players can select how many birds and pigs should sound like[^1^]. (When you have the old A-B-X characters, the four birds will sound like A, B, C, and X. In the new T-R-S characters, the four birds will sound like T, R, S, and X.)
 
The new features and levels will be released for all Angry Birds games this weekend. So the update will hit Angry Birds Space, Angry Birds, and Angry Birds Star Wars over the next few days. It will be released on all mobile platforms as well as Android phones and tablets[^2^]. Rovio has also announced that the main characters from the new update will be available for purchase with the actual Angry Birds games starting tomorrow. While the price of the main character is not yet known, the price of the T-R-S and the A-B-X characters will be cheaper than their normal versions[^2^].
