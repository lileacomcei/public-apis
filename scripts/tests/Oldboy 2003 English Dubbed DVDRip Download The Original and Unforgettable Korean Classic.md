If you are looking for a movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, look no further than Oldboy 2003.

It is based on a Japanese manga of the same name by Nobuaki Minegishi and Garon Tsuchiya.
 
The story follows Oh Dae-su (Choi Min-sik), a man who is kidnapped and imprisoned in a hotel-like cell for 15 years without any explanation. He is suddenly released and given five days to find out who imprisoned him and why. Along the way, he meets a young sushi chef named Mi-do (Kang Hye-jung), who helps him in his quest. But as he gets closer to the truth, he discovers that his captor has a twisted plan for him that involves a shocking secret from his past.

If you enjoyed Oldboy 2003, you might also want to check out the other two films in Park Chan-wook's Vengeance Trilogy: Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance (2002) and Lady Vengeance (2005). These films are not directly related to Oldboy 2003, but they share the same theme of revenge and the same dark and stylish aesthetic. They are also equally brilliant and provocative, exploring the complex and tragic consequences of violence and vengeance.
 
Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance tells the story of Ryu (Shin Ha-kyun), a deaf-mute factory worker who kidnaps the daughter of his boss to pay for his sister's kidney transplant. However, things go horribly wrong when the girl dies accidentally and Ryu's sister commits suicide. The girl's father, Park Dong-jin (Song Kang-ho), then vows to track down and kill everyone involved in the kidnapping.
 
Lady Vengeance follows Lee Geum-ja (Lee Young-ae), a woman who is released from prison after serving 13 years for a murder she did not commit. She was framed by a sadistic teacher named Mr. Baek (Choi Min-sik), who forced her to confess to killing a young boy. Lee Geum-ja then plots her revenge against Mr. Baek, with the help of some of her former cellmates and the parents of the boy.
 
Both films are available for download with English subtitles from this link. They are also not for the squeamish, as they contain graphic scenes of torture, murder, and gore. However, they are also masterpieces of filmmaking that will make you question your own sense of justice and morality.
 
Park Chan-wook's Vengeance Trilogy is a landmark in South Korean cinema and a must-see for any fan of Oldboy 2003. It is a trilogy that will haunt you and stay with you long after you watch it.
